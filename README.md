# SS2AM
Hello everyone! SS2AM here and this repository was created for our orbital project. We are in gemini or vostok level that requires us to make a software engineering project as well as do basic version control and github repo. 

Currently, we have three milestones:

Milestone 1: Our motivation for this project is to create a menu ordering application/software, with a more efficient and effective split bill feature, which then can be utilized by restaurants or the food industry. The software will give the users ability to differentiate between each individualsâ€™ order from the start by asking how many people are ordering, therefore making bill-splitting more convenient and less of a hassle when doing manual splits.
